 ## Extensions ##
 ---

 Extend existing data structures.
 You can add methods/properties to a `class`/`enum`/`struct` (even if you don't have the source code).

 ### Restrictions ###
 - can't override any methods or properties (can only add new ones)
   - would need to subclass to do this
 - properties cannot have storage (computed only)

 ### Best Practices ###
 - easily abused, so be careful!
 - should add clarity to readability, not obfuscate
 - don't use it as a substitute for good object-oriented design
 - best used (at least for beginners) for very small, well-contained helper functions
 - can be used to organize code, but requires architectural commitment
 - when in doubt (for now), don't do it
